# OCR services inside a AWS lambda functions
## Working with AWS Textract, S3, SQS and Tessaract.js

In this repository, I added my code on my take of working 
with AWS and two different OCR services. 
I am uploading every OCR result into the AWS S3 service 
and creating a pre-signed link for 3 min.

The modules I used are:
 * AWS-sdk
 * dotenv
 * file-type
 * tesseract.js
 * lodash
